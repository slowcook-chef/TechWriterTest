# EOS Tech Writer Coding Exercise
[2025-jan-24]

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:
- The project you are going to work on, downloaded and unzipped. 
- Download it from Box.com at [epicgames.box.com/~.](https://epicgames.box.com/s/kbancx9f7obfel0pfjyhyha8vqo5gv4b)
- A Windows PC with [Visual Studio 2022](http://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) installed. 
- An Epic Games account. 
  - You set up an Epic Games account in the Epic Games [Developer Portal](http://dev.epicgames.com/portal). 
  - As part of this you must set up an organization in the Epic Games Developer Portal. The organization can be whatever name you choose.
  - You do not need to configure the organization.
  - If you already have an Epic Games account, you can reuse it, you do not need to set up a new one.
- A product in the Epic Games [Developer Portal](http://dev.epicgames.com/portal).
  - You do not need to configure the product.
  - You will need the various IDs associated with your product and organization for EOS SDK configuration.
  - These IDs are available from your productâ€™s Product Settings page in the [Developer Portal](http://dev.epicgames.com/portal).
- The EOS SDK in C downloaded from the Epic Games [Developer Portal](http://dev.epicgames.com/portal).
  - The project you are going to work on uses **EOS SDK v1.16.4**.

## Task

You are provided with a project to work on. The project is a simple C++ console application that already implements the [EOS SDK](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-online-services) for authentication. You are to configure and implement EOS achievements in the project.

Note: The first time you build the project you need to copy *EOSSDK-Win64-Shipping.dll*
from ***StubGame/StubGame/sdk/Bin*** into the ***StubGame/x64/Debug*** directory.

You will need to:

- Create a means to tick the EOS platform using the EOS [Platform Interface](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/game-services/eos-platform-interface)
- Implement the EOS [Achievements Interface](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/game-services/achievements)
- Send a request to manually unlock an achievement and log a message when this is successfully sent.
- Receive a notification and log a message when an achievement is unlocked.
- Implement the EOS [Stats Interface](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/game-services/eos-stats-interface) and unlock an achievement via ingesting a stat.

## Guidance

- You are free to refer to online resources, the [EOS documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-online-services), and EOS SDK samples (available with the EOS SDK download).
- Please refrain from copying and pasting substantial blocks of code from external sources.
